# SoftRobot Sim2Real Framework

This repository implements a complete sim-to-real framework for pressure-actuated soft robots, combining high-fidelity SOFA finite element simulations with PyBullet physics modeling and data-driven surrogate models. The codebase accompanies our AIS journal submission demonstrating successful transfer from simulation to hardware.

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Contribution

**Problem**: Soft robots have complex, nonlinear dynamics that are difficult to model accurately, creating a significant sim-to-real gap that hinders effective control design and deployment.

**Solution**: A three-stage pipeline that (1) calibrates FEM parameters using SOFA simulations, (2) learns surrogate models for fast prediction via PyBullet, and (3) validates controllers on real hardware with quantified transfer performance.

## ðŸ“‹ Key Components Implemented

### 1. SOFA-based Model Calibration (`Code/ModelCalibration_SOFA/`)
- **Dynamic Controller** (`DynamicController.py`): Automated pressure profile generation and data collection
- **FEM Soft Robot** (`Manipulator_dynamic_actuation.py`): 3-actuator soft manipulator with TetrahedronFEMForceField
- **Material Models**: NeoHookean, MooneyRivlin, STVenantKirchhoff hyperelastic materials via MJED plugin
- **Pressure Actuation**: SurfacePressureConstraint for cavity-based pneumatic control
- **Data Export**: Automatic logging of pressure inputs, forces, positions, and velocities to CSV

### 2. PyBullet Surrogate Learning (`Code/PhysicsBasedSimulation_PyBullet/`)

  - 3-input, 3-output feedforward network with ReLU activations
  - StandardScaler normalization for inputs and outputs
  - Trained on `PressureThetaMappingData.csv`
- **L-BFGS Optimization** (`Optimization_LBFGS.py`): Inverse kinematics solver for target positioning

#### DynamicsLearning/

  - Input: temporal sequences of [Î¸X, Î¸Y, d, Fx, Fy, Fz]
  - Output: pressure commands [P1, P2, P3]
  - Transformer encoder with physics-based loss regularization
  - Trained on `Pybullet_joint_to_pos.csv` (100K+ samples)

#### RangeOfMotion/
